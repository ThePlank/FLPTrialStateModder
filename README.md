# how it works
there is a one byte flag in the flp that if set to 01 will make fl studio think it is not in trial mode 00 does the opposite
i just set the flag accordingly
it also sets all plugins/effects flags to the correct thing

## TODO

- make fl studio 21 work with it (high importance)
- do a ui overhaul (not very important at all)
